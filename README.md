# Music-on: Zoho Music Website UX Redesign

## Overview
This exercise focuses on improving the user experience (UX) of the Zoho Music website. The primary goal is to identify usability issues and optimize the navigation, content structure, and accessibility of key features like the 'Zoho Artists' page and the song download process. By conducting usability testing and analyzing feedback, we propose concrete improvements to streamline user interaction.

## Objectives
- Enhance the visibility and accessibility of the **Zoho Artists** section.
- Reduce the number of steps required to **find and download a song**.
- Introduce a **search feature** to assist users in navigating the website efficiently.
- Conduct usability testing to validate proposed improvements.

## Methodology
### 1. **Heuristic Evaluation**
We began by analyzing the current website structure and identifying usability issues based on established UX principles.

### 2. **Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Analysis**
We explored user motivations and goals to better understand why users visit the website and what they expect to accomplish.

### 3. **Card Sorting Workshop**
Participants organized website content into categories that felt most intuitive, helping us restructure the website navigation.

### 4. **Wireframing & Prototyping**
We designed wireframes to illustrate improved user flows and tested them for usability.

### 5. **Usability Testing**
Five participants performed key tasks (e.g., finding an artist, downloading a song), and we measured completion time, errors, and user feedback.

## Key Findings
- **Difficult Navigation:** Users struggled to find the 'Zoho Artists' page.
- **Inefficient Download Process:** Too many steps required to download a song.
- **Lack of Search Functionality:** Users had to rely on menu navigation, slowing them down.

## Proposed Improvements
1. **Improve Navigation Visibility** - Make 'Zoho Artists' and 'Downloads' more prominent in the menu.
2. **Simplify the Download Process** - Introduce a quick-download button next to each song.
3. **Add a Search Feature** - Allow users to search for artists, songs, or albums directly.
